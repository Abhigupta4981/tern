### TODO
- Move modules into a file called dockercommands.py. This is where the library of invokable shell commands via docker exec and other docker commands can live
- Move the pieces to extract sources for packages and versions from here
- Make a module called report.py to handle reporting functions
- Add a module to dockerfile.py to make subsections of docker instructions to handle multistage docker builds
- Accept arguments for --build-args
- Update this README
